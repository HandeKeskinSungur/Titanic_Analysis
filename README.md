# Exploring the Titanic Data Set
Data Analysis Project — Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree. Below you'll find the rest of the projects and I also wrote a [short post](https://collado.io/blog/2018/udacity-dand) about the experience.

* Exploratory data analysis
* Data wrangling
* Machine learning
* [Data visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/marccollado#!/vizhome/TitanicFinal_6/Titanic)


## Introduction
Was there a factor or combination of factors that contributed to the survival of the tragedy?

This data exploration will investigate the [Titanic data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) — containing information from its passengers, and will give an answer to this question, uncovering amazing insights along the way.


## Project Structure
The project was developed in Python using a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org). It also leveraged `Pandas` and `Numpy` to facilitate the data handling and the `Seaborn` library for data visualization.
