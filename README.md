## Introduction
Was there a factor or combination of factors that contributed to the survival of the tragedy?

This data exploration will investigate the [Titanic data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) — containing information from its passengers, and will give an answer to this question, uncovering amazing insights along the way.


## Project Structure
The project was developed in Python using a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org). It also leveraged `Pandas` and `Numpy` to facilitate the data handling and the `Seaborn` library for data visualization.
